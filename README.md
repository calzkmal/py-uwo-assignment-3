With the emergence of social media sites such as Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (also known as X), LinkedIn, and WhatsApp, more and more data is being produced and made accessible online in a textual format. This textual data, such as Tweets or Facebook posts, can be hard to process but is incredibly important for organizations as it offers a current snapshot of the public’s feelings (or sentiment) about a topic at a current point in time. Having a live view of your customer’s current sentiment about your products or the publics view of your political campaign can be critical for success.

Twitter is a social media site that allows users to post “tweets”, short (typically under 280 characters) messages. It is commonly used by people to “tweet” aspects of their daily lives and current opinions about a variety of topics. This “flow of tweets” has become a way to study or at least guess at how people feel about various aspects of the world, their own lives, or a specific topic. For example, analysis of tweets has been used to try to determine how certain geographical regions may be voting or their opinion on a recently announced product.

This is accomplished by analyzing the content, the words, and phrases, in tweets. For example, analysis of keywords or phrases in tweets can be used to determine how popular or unpopular a movie might be. This is often referred to as sentiment analysis.

In this assignment, I will be performing a sentiment analysis on a dataset of Tweets collected in February 2023 relating to a business, product, or security. The end goal is to produce a report that summarizes the sentiment of the tweets contained in the dataset.
